# ATVS
ATVS (Anti Theft Vehicle System) is an IoT-based solution designed for 2-wheelers to detect motion gestures and send alerts via GSM. The system utilizes an MPU6050 sensor to detect specific gestures and respond accordingly, such as making a phone call when an "up" gesture is detected, providing an effective anti-theft mechanism.

# Features
Detects motion gestures using the MPU6050 sensor.
Maps sensor data to gesture commands.
Sends alerts via GSM module based on detected gestures.
Provides real-time sensor data via Serial Monitor.

#Components
Arduino
MPU6050 Sensor
GSM Module
Buzzer
Various resistors and wires

#Usage
Setup the hardware according to the provided circuit diagram.
Upload the code to the Arduino.
Monitor real-time data on the Serial Monitor and observe the actions taken based on gestures.
